## Document Extrtaction Process

### Document Layout Analysis

An important step in the process of extracting information from documents is to recognize the layout of a document [@zhong_publaynet_2019].

Getting the order of texts correct
align captions to tables and figure
identify headings, tables and figures

One of the most popular datasets used for training and benchmarking is PubLayNet (see [PubLayNet on paperswithcode.com](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/document-layout-analysis-on-publaynet-val)). It contains over 360_000 document automatically annotated images from scientific articles publicly available on PubMed Central [@zhong_publaynet_2019, p. 1]. This was possible, because the articles have been provided in PDF and XML format. For the annotations most text categories (e.g. text, caption, footnote) have been aggregated into one category. <-- is this a problem for later approaches where a visual and textual model work hand in hand to identify e.g. table captions?

Manual annotated datasets often were limited to several hundred pages. Deep learning methods need a much larger training dataset. Previously optical character recognition (OCR) methods were used.

Identify potentially interesting pages with text / regex search. Check if there is a table present on this page.
