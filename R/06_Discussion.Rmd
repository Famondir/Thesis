## Limitations

### table extraction

* found mistakes in gold standard with the llm results; mistakes found by human double check
* new lines / splitted lines
* test synthetic hypothesis with pymupdf extract

#### Regex baseline

* synthetic tables have been generated with cell lines because this should have improved the performance of a table extraction approach (not conducted)- maybe this is confusing pdfium? Or the zoom level?

### classification

* Qwen 2.5 hat zweiseitige GuV von IBB entdeckt und zur Anpassung der Ground Truth
* predictor: n_big_tables (tf or llm relevant?)

## Not covered

* OCR
* fine-tuning
* using something smaller (e.g. LSTMs) instead LLMs
* building application, UX design (ref Ambacher 2024)
* table extraction (either VLLMs or classic approaches <-- tried tabula but was not successful (because of missing visual traits)?)

in company document next / previous year more helpful than years further away?

## Outlook

* ensemble from multiple models or are errors systematic? (e.g. Wohnungsbaugenossenschaften splitting some rows in multiple and none is picked?)
* check for halluzination vs wrong placed / repeated numbers
* no perfect score even with synthetic data
* flexible extraction (name something, find it, get it)

### Table extraction

building a document extraction database document by document can improve performance taking advantage of same-company rag in-context learning
