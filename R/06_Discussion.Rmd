## Table extraction

building a document extraction database document by document can improve performance taking advantage of same-company rag in-context learning

### Regex baseline

* synthetic tables have been generated with cell lines because this should have improved the performance of a table extraction approach (not conducted)- maybe this is confusing pdfium? Or the zoom level?

## Not covered

* OCR
* fine-tuning
* using something smaller (e.g. LSTMs) instead LLMs
* building application, UX design (ref Ambacher 2024)
* table extraction (either VLLMs or classic approaches <-- tyred tabula but was not successful (because of missing visual traits)?)
