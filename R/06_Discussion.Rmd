## Limitations

### table extraction

-   found mistakes in gold standard with the llm results; mistakes found by human double check
-   new lines / splitted lines
-   test synthetic hypothesis with pymupdf extract
-   2.4 % wrong gold standard creation

#### Regex baseline

-   synthetic tables have been generated with cell lines because this should have improved the performance of a table extraction approach (not conducted)- maybe this is confusing pdfium? Or the zoom level?

### classification

-   Qwen 2.5 hat zweiseitige GuV von IBB entdeckt und zur Anpassung der Ground Truth
-   predictor: n_big_tables (tf or llm relevant?)
-   Why it is important to have a good recall (or top n accuracy)
-   bad performance for Maverick with more models relied to FP8 model version?

One could build an application that is not asking for a human intervention for reported confidences over 0.9 and then give the possibility to change the page to extract information from later on.

For humans: Easily identifiable if page has a big table with numbers but not so easy to spot the Aktiva / Passiva label.

## Not covered

-   OCR
-   fine-tuning
-   using something smaller (e.g. LSTMs) instead LLMs
-   building application, UX design (ref Ambacher 2024)
-   table extraction (either VLLMs or classic approaches \<-- tried tabula but was not successful (because of missing visual traits)?)

in company document next / previous year more helpful than years further away?

## Outlook

-   ensemble from multiple models or are errors systematic? (e.g. Wohnungsbaugenossenschaften splitting some rows in multiple and none is picked?)
-   check for halluzination vs wrong placed / repeated numbers
-   no perfect score even with synthetic data
-   flexible extraction (name something, find it, get it)
-   

### Table extraction

building a document extraction database document by document can improve performance taking advantage of same-company rag in-context learning

predictions for barrierefreie documents of WBM empty, one time because the pages showed **GuV**; also no predictions for Zoo 2024 **Passiva**
