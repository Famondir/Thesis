# Results

\addthumb{Chapter~\thechapter.1}{\textbf{\Huge{\thechapter}\Large{.1}}}{white}{gray}

This chapter presents the results for the two research questions of this
thesis:

1.  How can we use \acr{LLM}s effectively to locate specific information
    in a financial report?
2.  How can we use \acr{LLM}s effectively to extract these information
    from the document?

Section \@ref(page-identification-introduction) presents the results for
the first research question. Section
\@ref(table-extraction-introduction) presents the results for the second
question.

Each section will start with an overview about the specific sub tasks as
well about the models, methods and data used to investigate the research
question. The subsections present the results of the sub tasks. At the
end of each section all results get compared and summarized.

## Page identification {#page-identification-introduction}

```{r count-benchmark-documents, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, cache=TRUE, cache.extra = tools::md5sum(c("../benchmark_truth/aktiva_passiva_guv_table_pages_no_ocr.csv", "./scripts/page_identification_preparations.R"))}
source("./scripts/page_identification_preparations.R")

num_multiple_tables_per_document <- df_targets_no_ocr %>%
  anti_join(consecutive_pages, by = c("filepath", "page", "type")) %>% 
  arrange(filepath, page) %>%
  group_by(filepath, type) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  filter(count > 1) %>%
  group_by(filepath) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  nrow()

multiple_tables_per_type_and_document <- data_unnested %>%
  anti_join(consecutive_pages, by = c("filepath", "page", "type")) %>% 
  arrange(filepath, page) %>%
  group_by(filepath, type) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  filter(count > 1) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  summarise("multiple targets in document" = n())

df_special_targets <- multiple_tables_per_type_and_document %>% left_join(consecutive_pages %>% group_by(type) %>% summarise("target two pages long" = n())) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,coalesce,0)
```

The first research question asks, how \acr{LLM}s can be used, to
effectively locate specific information in a financial report. The task
for this thesis is identifying the pages where the balance sheet
(*Bilanz*) and the profit-and-loss-and-statement (*Gewinn- und
Verlustrechnung, GuV*) are located. The balance sheet is composed of two
tables showing the assets (*Aktiva*) and liabilities (*Passiva*) of a
company. Often these two tables are on separate pages. Hereafter, the
German terms **Aktiva**, **Passiva** and \acr{GuV} will be used.

@li_extracting_2023 describes two ways to identify the relevant pages
(see Figure \@ref(fig:extraction-framework-flow-chart)). For longer
documents they propose to use the \acr{TOC} to determine a page range
that includes the information of interest. In addition, they develop
target specific regular expressions and rules to filter out irrelevant
pages[^05_results-1]. The result of this "Page Range Refinement" is then
passed to the \acr{LLM} to extract information from.

[^05_results-1]: Personal opinion: Developing well performing regular
    expressions can be a very tedious and setting appropriate rules
    requires some domain knowledge. It can be worth the effort if there
    are a lot of documents with similar information to extract. For this
    thesis it took multiple months. At least, now there is kind of a
    pipeline one can reuse, exchanging the rules and key word lists.
    Thus the next similar task should be solved faster.

This section is presenting four approaches to identify the
page[^05_results-2] of interest.

[^05_results-2]: In some cases the information of interest is spanning
    two pages. These rare cases are not covered from the approaches
    presented here, yet.

-   Subsection \@ref(regex-page-identification) presents the performance
    of a page range refinement using a list of key words with a regular
    expression.
-   Subsection \@ref(toc-understanding) presents the performance of a
    \acr{TOC} understanding approach
-   Subsection \@ref(llm-page-identification) presents the performance
    of a text classification using \acr{LLM}s.
-   Subsection \@ref(tf-classifier) presents the performance of a
    term-frequency approach.

In subsection \@ref(comparison-page-identification) the results get
compared and summarized. Subsection \@ref() proposes an efficient
combination of approaches to solve the task of this thesis and discusses
its limitations.

###  {.unlisted .unnumbered}

::: paragraph-start
##### Dataset describtion

Figure \@ref(fig:document-base-page-identification) shows how the
document base for the tasks in this section is composed[^05_results-3].
Overall `r num_documents` annual reports from `r num_companies`
companies are used. For this thesis the tables of interest are those
that show **Aktiva**, **Passiva** and **GuV**. Among the
`r total_pages_no_ocr` pages `r num_tables` tables have to be identified
on `r num_target_pages` pages. Figure
\@ref(fig:document-base-page-identification) also gives an impression on
how many pages the documents have. The documents of *IBB* tend to be
longer. The documents of *Amt f√ºr Statistik Berlin-Brandenburg* tend to
be shorter.
:::

[^05_results-3]: I downloaded all publicly available annual reports for
    some of the companies shown in the first row of Figure
    \@ref(fig:beteiligungsunternehmen). I assumed that this will give a
    representative sample of document structures for the other companies
    of the same type. Realizing that the degewo AG reports would require
    ocr preprocessing I additionally downloaded reports for GESOBAU AG.
    This approach could have been more systematic. For the second task I
    downloaded reports for all companies available and tried to use a
    balanced amount of reports per company.

```{r, eval = knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis', class.chunk='pre-detail'}
cat("<p>You can have a look at the ground truth data unfolding the following details element.</p>")
```

```{r ground-truth-tables-of-interest, eval = knitr::is_html_output(), echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, class.chunk='hideme', results='asis'}
df_targets_no_ocr %>% render_table(
  caption = "Showing all pages of interest with the target table type and filepath.",
  ref = opts_current$get("label")
  )
```

```{r document-base-page-identification, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Showing the number of pages (bar height) and number of documents (number above the bar) per company for the data used for the page identification task. Some documents would require ocr before being processed and were not used.", results='asis'}
df_pages %>% group_by(company) %>% mutate(
  docs_per_company = n(), pages_per_company = sum(pages)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = company, y = pages, fill = needs_ocr), color = "#00000033") +
  geom_text(
    data = . %>% group_by(company) %>% slice_head(n = 1),
    aes(x = company, y = pages_per_company, label = docs_per_company, group = company),
    stat = "identity",
    vjust = -0.5,
    size = 3
  ) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 30))
```

Table \@ref(tab:display_multiple_tables_per_type_and_document) shows how
many documents have multiple target tables per type and how many target
tables span two pages. In total `r num_consecutive_pages` tables are
distributed on two pages. In `r num_multiple_tables_per_document`
documents there are multiple tables per type of interest. There are
`r num_two_tables_on_one_page` pages with two target tables (**Aktiva**
and **Passiva**) on it.

```{r display-multiple-tables-per-type-and-document, echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
df_special_targets %>% render_table(
  caption = "Showing the number of documents with multiple target tables per type and the number of target tables that span two pages.",
  ref = opts_current$get("label")
  )
```

This task is broken down to a classification task all of the approaches
presented in this section but the \acr{TOC} understanding approach.

Thus, we prompt the \acr{LLM} to classify if the text extract of a given
page

for implementation: As described in \@ref(text-extraction-benchmark)
open source libraries have been used to extract the text from the annual
reports.

### Baseline: Regex {#regex-page-identification}

```{r page-identification-regex-data-loading, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.extra = tools::md5sum("data_storage/page_identification_regex.rds")}
data_page_identification_regex <- readRDS("data_storage/page_identification_regex.rds")

metrics <- data_page_identification_regex$metrics
metric_summaries <- data_page_identification_regex$metric_summaries
metrics_by_company_and_type <- data_page_identification_regex$metrics_by_company_and_type

metrics_plot_regex_page_identification <- metrics %>% bind_rows() %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -c(package, method, classification_type),
    names_to = "metric",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>%
  filter(metric %in% c(
    # "acc", 
    "precision", "recall", "F1")) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_jitter(aes(x = method, y = value, color = package), alpha = 0.5, width = 0.2, height = 0) +
  facet_grid(metric~classification_type) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 30)) +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1))

# creating combi table
df_list <- list()

for (type in c("Aktiva", "Passiva", "GuV")) {
  df_temp <- metric_summaries[type][[1]] %>%
    mutate_if(
        is.numeric, 
        ~ifelse(
            . == max(., na.rm = TRUE),
            paste0("**", format(round(., 3), nsmall=3), "**"),
            format(round(., 3), nsmall=3)
        )
    ) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = stat, values_from = c(precision, recall, F1)) %>% mutate(
        precision = paste(precision_mean, "¬±", precision_sd),
        recall = paste(recall_mean, "¬±", recall_sd),
        F1 = paste(F1_mean, "¬±", F1_sd),
    ) %>% 
    select(-ends_with("_mean")) %>% select(-ends_with("_sd")) %>% mutate_all(~str_remove(., " ¬± NA")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(method)) %>% mutate(.before = 2, type = type)
  # rownames(df_temp) <- df_temp$method
  
  df_list[[type]] <- df_temp
}

df_combined <- bind_rows(df_list) %>% bold_value_in_table()
```

The first approach presented in this section is, to use a key word list
and \acrfull{regex} to filter out irrelevant pages. It is setting the
performance baseline for the following approaches. Building a sound
regular expression often is an iterative process. In a first approach a
very *simple regex* was implemented. To increase the recall to 1.0 the
regular expression was extended[^05_results-4]. This second regex is
called *exhaustive regex*. In a third attempt minor changes have been
made to the *exhaustive regex* to increase the precision without
decreasing the recall. This regular expression is called *exhausitve
regex restricted*. The regular expressions can be found in the appendix
(see section \@ref(regex-page-identification-code)).

[^05_results-4]: The idea is that the regular expression approach is
    computationally cheap. If we can rely on the fact, that it keeps all
    relevant pages we can use additional, computationally more expensive
    approaches to further refine the page range.

Table \@ref(tab:display-metrics-regex-page-identification-all) shows the
mean performance for precision, recall and F1 for the three regular
expressions for the three types of pages to identify[^05_results-5]. It
was possible to create a regular expression that has a high recall for
all target types. The precision is low for all tested regular
expressions and target types. Figure
\@ref(fig:display-metrics-plot-regex-page-identification-details) gives
insight into performance differences between the companies. There is
only one document from *Berlin Energie und Netzholding* where the
**GuV** is not identified except with the *exhausitve regex
restricted*[^05_results-6].

[^05_results-5]: See Figure
    \@ref(fig:display-metrics-plot-regex-page-identification) for a
    graphical representation.

[^05_results-6]: I don't understand why the restricted version is
    finding the page but the non-restricted regex is not.

The regular expressions have been tested on the texts extracted with
multiple Python libraries. The reported standard deviations are very
small. This means that there are no substantial differences in the
extracted texts on a word level[^05_results-7]. But table
\@ref(tab:display-data-text-extraction) in section
\@ref(text-extraction-benchmark) shows that there are differences in the
extraction speed.

[^05_results-7]: Since the results are not depending on the text
    extraction library, the *exhaustive regex restricted* ran only with
    the text extracted by the fastest extraction library: *pdfium*. This
    library is used for the most tasks in this thesis. Later faced
    issues with the text extracted by *pdfium* are discussed in \@ref().

Todo: \* look into details where they differ and if it is because of a
line break or whitespace?

```

### Table of Contents understanding {#toc-understanding}

```{r page-identification-toc-data-loading, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, cache=TRUE, cache.extra = tools::md5sum(c("scripts/page_identification_toc_data_loading.R", "../benchmark_truth/toc_data.json", "../Python/pdf_texts.json"))}
source("scripts/page_identification_toc_data_loading.R")
```

The second approach presented in this section leverages the \acr{TOC}
understanding capabilities of \acr{LLM}s. @li_extracting_2023 use this
approach with long documents as a first step to determine a page range
of interest. If the predicted page range is correct and narrow, this
approach is more efficient than processing the whole document with a
\acr{LLM} directly. The \acr{TOC} in a \acr{PDF} document can be
embedded in a standardized, machine readable format or be presented in
varying, human readable forms of text on any page. Of course there are
documents without any \acr{TOC}.

Thus, the task is investigated based on two different input data formats
In one case the \acr{LLM} is provided with text extracted from the
beginning of the document. In the other case the \acr{LLM} is provided
with the Markdown formatted version of the machine readable \acr{TOC}
embedded in the document. Subsection \@ref(text-based-toc-understanding)
shows the results for the text based approach. Subsection
\@ref(code-based-toc-understanding) shows the results for the approach,
using the embedded \acr{TOC}.

Additionally, each approach is performed three times with minor changes
in the prompt. The prompts used for both approaches can be found at
\@ref(toc-understanding-promts). The prompt was adjusted two times to
tackle shortcomings in the results. The first change adds the
information, that assets and liabilities are part of the balance sheet.
It is the balance sheet, that is listed in the \acr{TOC} - not the
assets or liabilities itself. The second change specifies the
information, that assets and liabilities are often on separated pages,
into, liabilities often are found on the page after the assets.

The code can be found in:

-   "benchmark_jobs/page_identification/toc_extraction_mistral.ipynb"

-   "benchmark_jobs/page_identification/toc_extraction_qwen.ipynb"

Discussion:

-   @li_extracting_2023 did not report any issues with this approach.
    They use few-shot learning and Chain-of-Thought techniques to help
    the \acr{LLM} to understand the task. They ask just for one
    information at a time.
-   ChatGPT 4 vs Mistral 2410 8B (huge parameter difference)
-   For a lot of short annual reports one can find the tables of
    interest within the first eight pages as well.

#### Details for the approaches {#text-based-toc-understanding}

::: paragraph-start
##### Text based

@li_extracting_2023 used the \acr{TOC} to identify the pages of
interest. In their approach the table of contents is extracted from the
text. Based on their observation, that the \acr{TOC} in \acr{ACFR}s is
found within the initial 165 lines of the converted document
[@li_extracting_2023, p. 20], they use the first 200 lines of text.
:::

My initial expectation was to find the \acr{TOC} within the first five
pages. Often there are way less than 200 lines of text on the five first
pages (see Figure \@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-histogram)). In my
approach the first step is to prompt the \acr{LLM} to identify and
extract the \acr{TOC} in a given text extract\^[The prompt can be found
in section \@ref(toc-understanding-promts)]. For the same documents
Mistral 2410 8B finds\^[The strings extracted in this step have not been
checked in detail.]

-   `r n_found_toc_5_pages` strings that should represent a table of
    contents among the first five pages.

-   `r n_found_toc_200_lines` strings that should represent a table of
    contents among the first 200 lines.

```{r page-identification-toc-histogram, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, fig.width=8, fig.height=3, out.width="80%", dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Histogram of the number of lines in the first 5 pages of the annual reports"}
df_num_lines %>% 
  filter(filepath %in% df_targets_no_ocr$filepath) %>% # filter documents that would need ocr preprocessing
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = num_lines), bins = 20) +
  labs(x = "Number of lines in the first 5 pages", y = "Count") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, max(df_num_lines$num_lines)))
```

::: paragraph-start
##### Machine readable TOC based {#code-based-toc-understanding}

I also tested to use the \acr{TOC} representation embedded within the
PDF files. First, this limits the text amount to process. Second, this
hopefully increases the quality of the data passed to the \acr{LLM}.
`r n_toc` of the `r n_toc+n_no_toc` annual reports have a machine
readable embedded \acr{TOC}. The embedded \acr{TOC} is converted into
markdown format before it gets passed to the \acr{LLM}. Here is an
example:
:::

```{r page-identification-markdown-code, echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag}
cat(toc_data$files_with_toc$markdown_toc[[1]])
```

#### Results

::: paragraph-start
##### Comparison of the different approaches: base prompt

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-toc-analysis-table) shows that the
machine readable \acr{TOC} approach has the highest rate of correct page
ranges for all types with the base prompt. It also predicts the most
correct page ranges in absolute numbers for **Aktiva** and **GuV**.
Thus, it also has the highest rate of correct page ranges based on the
total number of page ranges to identify over all documents - no matter,
if there was a \acr{TOC} of any type in the document or not - for
**Aktiva** and **GuV** of around `r perc_correct_total_base` %.
:::

```{r page-identification-toc-analysis-table, echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
df_toc_benchmark %>% group_by(benchmark_type, type) %>% 
  reframe(n_correct = sum(in_range), n = n()) %>% 
  left_join(data_unnested %>% group_by(type) %>% summarise(n_total = n())) %>% 
  mutate(
    perc_correct = n_correct/n*100,
    perc_correct_total = n_correct/n_total*100
    ) %>% 
  group_by(type) %>% 
  mutate_at(
    vars(perc_correct, n_correct, perc_correct_total), 
    ~ifelse(
      . == max(., na.rm = TRUE),
      paste0("**", format_floats(.), "**"),
      format_floats(.)
    )
  ) %>% 
  render_table(alignment="llrrrrr", caption="Comparing the number and percentage of correct identified page ranges among the approaches.", ref = opts_current$get("label"), dom="t")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-analysis) shows that the amount
of correct predicted page ranges for **Passiva** is lowest for all
approaches but can be improved by simply extending the predicted end
page number by one the most. This improvement would be best for the
machine readable \acr{TOC} approach. This approach is the only one,
where the number of correct page ranges **Aktiva** would not increase if
we extend its range by one. Table
\@ref(tab:page-identification-toc-analysis-same-end-page) shows that
this is the case, because the machine readable \acr{TOC} approach
predicts the same end page for **Passiva** as for **Aktiva** in
`r perc_equal_end_page_mr` % of the cases, even though the prompt for
all approaches included the information, that **Aktiva** and **Passiva**
are on separate pages.

```{r page-identification-toc-analysis, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, out.width="100%", dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Comparing number of found TOC and amount of correct and incorrect predicted page ranges"}
df_toc_benchmark %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = type, fill = in_range, colour = min_distance <= 1)) +
  geom_text(
    data = . %>% filter(in_range == TRUE),
    aes(x = type, label = paste0(round(perc_correct, 2), "")),
    stat = "count",
    vjust = 1.2,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = type, label = paste0(round(1-perc_correct, 2), "")),
    stat = "count",
    vjust = 1.5,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~benchmark_type, nrow = 1)
```

```{r page-identification-toc-analysis-same-end-page, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
df_toc_benchmark %>%
  filter(type != "GuV") %>%
  group_by(benchmark_type, filepath) %>%
  summarise(all_equal = n_distinct(end_page) == 1) %>% 
  group_by(benchmark_type) %>% 
  reframe(equal_end_page = sum(all_equal), n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(perc_equal_end_page = round(equal_end_page/n*100,1)) %>% 
  render_table(alignment="lrrr", caption="Comparing the number and percentage end pages prediction for Aktiva and Passiva that are equal.", ref = opts_current$get("label"), dom="t")
```

::: paragraph-start
##### Comparison of the different approaches: advanved prompts

As a first attempt, to increase the correct page range rate for
**Passiva** I tried to specify, that assets and liabilities are part of
the balance sheet. This did work for the text based approaches, but not
for the machine readable approach (see Figure
\@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-analysis-balanced)). Figure
\@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-analysis-next-page) shows that it is
more successful, to explicit tell the \acr{LLM} that the liabilities
table is often on the page, after the assets table.
:::

```{r page-identification-toc-analysis-next-page, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, out.width="100%", dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Comparing number of fount TOC and amount of correct and incorrect predicted page ranges"}
next_page_df_toc_benchmark %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = type, fill = in_range, colour = min_distance <= 1)) +
  geom_text(
    data = . %>% filter(in_range == TRUE),
    aes(x = type, label = paste0(round(perc_correct, 2), "")),
    stat = "count",
    vjust = 1.2,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  geom_text(
    aes(x = type, label = paste0(round(1-perc_correct, 2), "")),
    stat = "count",
    vjust = 1.5,
    color = "white"
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~benchmark_type, nrow = 1) # +
  # theme(
  #   legend.position = "bottom"
  # )
```

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-toc-analysis-table-next-page) shows
the results from the final zero shot prompt. The machine readable
\acr{TOC} approach is now predicting best for all types. Nevertheless, a
correct page range prediction rate below `r worst_finaLcorrect_rate_toc`
% is still unsufficient to build downstream task on withou human
checkups. Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-toc-gpu-time-comparison)
shows, that the machine readable \acr{TOC} approach is the fastest as
well.

```{r page-identification-toc-analysis-table-next-page, echo=FALSE, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
next_page_df_toc_benchmark %>% group_by(benchmark_type, type) %>% 
  reframe(n_correct = sum(in_range), n = n()) %>%

Table \@ref(tab:page-range-prediction-performance-table) shows, that
this advantage of the machine readable \acr{TOC} approach is not coming
from wide predicted page ranges. It has the smallest median range size
among all approaches. Figure
\@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-range-plot) shows, that especially the
ranges for **GuV** are not normally distributed. Some far off lying
range sizes are shifting the mean off from the median.

Figure \@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-range-logprobs) shows that the
confidence of the \acr{LLM}s responses is higher for the machine
readable \acr{TOC} approach as well. Besides a single group that was
predicted far off, the page ranges are closer to the correct pages too.
A linear regression of the correlation between minimal page distance and
logistic probability shows that is has a similar slope for all
approaches and target types.

##### Machine readable TOC approach specific results

Figure \@ref(fig:page-identification-toc-mr-degration) shows, that
correct predictions for the page range are more probable when the
embedded \acr{TOC} has a medium number of entries. It is possible to
drop documents with less than `r min_n_entries_max_correct` without
loosing a single correct prediction. This means that the \acr{LLM} was
not able to make a correct prediction for documents with \acr{TOC}, that
have less then `r min_n_entries_max_correct` entries. This is not
surprising since neither **Bilanz** nor **GuV** are mentioned there
explicit.
:::

It has no big influence on the predictions, if the \acr{TOC} is passed
formatted as markdown or json. With the json formatted \acr{TOC} it
found two more correct page ranges[^05_results-8]. This was tested
because the relation between heading and value for the column
*page_number* might have been clearer[^05_results-9] in json for a
one-dimensional working \acr{LLM}.

[^05_results-8]: This result is based on a single test run.

[^05_results-9]: With json the key *page_number* gets repeated every
    line, while it is just mentiones once in the beginning of the
    markdown formatted tables.

```{r page-identification-toc-mr-degration, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Showing the amount of correct and incorrect predicted page ranges (bars) and the percentage of correct predictions (black line)."}

The third approach we present in this section, uses pretrained
\acr{LLM}s to classify, if a given text extract is including any of the
target tables. Two classification approaches are presented.

On the one hand, a binary classification is used three times, to
predict, if the text extract is including an **Aktiva**, **Passiva** or
**GuV** table, once at a time. In this case the \acr{LLM} is forced to
answer with either *yes* or *no*. On the other hand, the \acr{LLM}
performed a \\acr{mcc]. For the \acr{mcc} the \acr{LLM} is forced to
answer *Aktiva*, *Passiva*, *GuV* or *other*. The prompts can be found
in appendix in section \@ref(classification-prompts).

The different classification tasks are combined with different prompting
strategies. A zero shot approach is setting the baseline. In a second
approach the excerpt of the relevant law is provided with the context.
Additionally, three few shot approaches are used.

In the few shot approaches text examples and a correct classification
for the text examples are provided. Figure
\@ref(fig:comparing-actual-number-of-in-context-examples-plot) shows how
many examples the \acr{LLM} gets provided, depending on the
classification type and chosen parameter *n_example*[^05_results-10].
For both approaches three example selection strategies are implemented.
First, random examples for each page type get sampled from the truth
dataset. Second, a vector database provides the entries that are closest
to the target text for each page type. Third, the vector database just
provides the texts that are closest to the target text without
considering the page type of the examples returned.

[^05_results-10]: See also Table
    \@ref(tab:comparing-actual-number-of-in-context-examples).

For the binary classification task the \acr{LLM} is provided with more
examples for the target type than for other types. Thus, the number of
examples and tokens is reduced. This should reduce the runtime as well.
On the same time the \acr{LLM} should get enough information about the
structure and contents of the target class and some information how it
differs from other big tables or general text pages.

For the \acr{mcc} the same amount of every possible class is provided.
Thus, the relation between the parameter *n_examples* and the number of
tokens to process is stronger for the *n_random_examples* and
*n_rag_examples* strategies.

The slope for the top-n-rag-examples strategy is the same for both approaches. The line for the strategies n-random-examples and n-rag-examples is equal within each approach."}

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-llm-overview) shows, which models
have been used in the classification benchmarks. Overall
`r binary_task$n_models` models from `r binary_task$n_model_families`
model families have been tested. Prerequirement for a model to be tested
is, that it can be used with the \acr{vllm} library, accessed via
hugging face and fits into the combined VRAM of 8 nvidia B200 graphic
cards (1.536 TB). The models cover a wide range of (active) parameter
sizes. Especially for the Qwen family many models of different parameter
sizes are used in the benchmark, to investigate if there is a clear
minimum amount of parameters needed, to solve the classification task.

The results of the benchmarks have been logged as \acr{json} files
totaling in 2.1 GB of data for the final results.

#### Binary classification

Table \@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-page-identification-binary) shows the
best performing combination of model family and prompting method for
each classification target type. The classification of **GuV** tables
works best and is solved almost perfectly. The F1 score for **Aktiva**
and **Passiva** are 0.07 lower for the top performing model. The median
F1 score of **GuV** is `r top_performer_binary_median_guv` 0.1 higher
than the median F1 score for **Aktiva**
(`r top_performer_binary_median_aktiva`) and 0.2 higher than the median
F1 score for **Passiva**
(`r round(top_performer_binary_median_passiva, 2)`).

Mistral 8B Instruct 2410 is performing best for the binary
classification task for each target type. Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct
is performing second best for **Aktiva** and **GuV** and is close to the
second best for **Passiva** as well. The runtime of Mistral 8B Instruct
2410 is four times lower than the runtime of
Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct. In addition, the time to load
Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct into the VRAM is much
longer[^05_results-11], because it has a total of 109B parameters. It
was surprising that Googles gemma models perform so bad[^05_results-12].

[^05_results-11]: It takes around 30 minutes to setup a vllm instance
    with Llama-4 Scout compared to 4:30 minutes setuptime for Mistral 8B
    2410.

[^05_results-12]: This is not due to a temporary technical problems
    caused by a bug in the transformers version shipped with the vllm
    0-9-2 image. Those problems have been overcome. The performance
    stays bad.

```{r table-metrics-llm-page-identification-binary, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results="asis", class.chunk="big-table"}
top_performer_binary %>% 
  render_table(alignment="llllrrr", caption="Overview of benchmarked LLMs for the binary classification tasks. Limiting the number of examples provided for the few shot approach to 3.", ref = opts_current$get("label"))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:binary-classification-result-mistral-plot) shows, the
classification performance for Mistral 8B 2410 in detail. It shows the
F1 score for each target type over the models runtime. It shows the
results for the different prompting strategies (*method_families*) with
differently colored shapes. The *zero_shot* strategy performs worst with
a F1 score below 0.6. Next come the *law_context* and
*top_n_rag_examples* strategy. Above those the *n_random_examples* and
finally the *n_rag_examples* strategy perform best.

The shape is giving information, if the example proveded to the
\acr{LLM} are selected from other companies than the target table comes
from only, or if they can also be selected from documents of the same
company. This is only relevant for strategies that get the examples
picked by the documents vector embedding distances. The \acr{LLM}
performs better[^05_results-13], if examples from documents of the same
company can be used. If this is not permitted, the *n_random_example*
approach performs better than the *n_rag_example* for the classification
of **GuV** and **Passiva** tables.

[^05_results-13]: It has a better F1 score, when examples from the same
    company are permitted. The recall is better with examples from same
    company. The precision is better without. The improvement in the
    recall is stronger.

The number inside of the shapes is referring to the *n_examples*
function parameter. Most models got benchmarked with an *n_examples*
value of up to three. The actual number of examples provided to the
models is depending on the method family / example selection strategy
and can be looked up in Table
\@ref(tab:comparing-actual-number-of-in-context-examples).

The best performing model, Mistral 8B 2410, was provided with mode
examples to investigate the effect of a richer context. The predictions
do not get better by providing more and more examples. Figure
\@ref(fig:binary-classification-result-mistral-plot) shows, that the
improvements get smaller naturally going from three to five examples
while approaching an F1 score of 1.0.

But for the *n_rag_example* strategy we find a significant drop in the
F1 score, if we set the *n_examples* to five[^05_results-14] and
examples pages come from annual reports of other companies. This is
caused by a sever recall drop. For the *n_random_example* strategy we
see a small drop with the F1 score for the class **Passiva** as well.
Taking into account that the runtime also almost is twice as high, this
is very inefficient.

[^05_results-14]: In this case five examples for the target table type
    and two examples for each other type are provided, totaling at
    twelve examples.

Figure \@ref(fig:binary-classification-result-mistral-plot) also shows,
that the results are stable[^05_results-15]. Running the benchmark three
times shows similar results in the F1 score for each strategy. This is
reflected by closely overlapping shapes of the same color with the same
number within.

[^05_results-15]: Earlier experiments on a subset of the pages have been
    run five times indicating stable results. Running the experiments up
    to tree times in this very task indicate this as well.

Figure
\@ref(fig:binary-classification-result-mistral-many-random-examples-plot)
shows the experiments for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 with *n_examples*
greater or equal three. This time the actual number of examples provided
to the \acr{LLM} are shown in the shapes to increase the comparability
among the different strategies. Additionally, it shows results for the
*top_n_rag_example* strategy with *n_examples* up to 13. The F1 score of
the *top_n_rag_example* strategy stays lower than the F1 score of the
*n_rag_examples* strategy, even though there are more examples used.
This is mainly caused by lower precision scores, probably because there
are no contrasting examples provided.

Figure \@ref(fig:binary-classification-performance-over-runtime) and
Figure
\@ref(fig:binary-classification-performance-over-runtime-full-time)
shows the F1 performance over normalized rundtime for all benchmarked
models. Comparing Mistral-8B-Instruct-2410 with
Mistral-124B-Instruct-2411 shows that one can spend over tenfold amount
of computation power without getting better results.

It also shows, that with Qwen 2.5 it needs at least the 3B parameter
model to achieve good results. Comparing the 32B and 72B parameter
models shows, that th performance does not increase anymore, but starts
to decrease. For Qwen 3 it shows, that only the newer mix of experts
models give reasonable results.

The mix of expert models show good performance for the Llama 4 family as
well and reduce the compute time compared with the 72B models of LLama
3. But for LLama 4 Maverick the performance drops using the
*n_rag_examples* strategy with three *n_examples*. The performance of
Llama 3.1 70B was higher than the performance of Llama 3.3 70B.

Summary:

Neither do newer generations always improve the performance for the
binary classification task, nor do more parameters always improve or at
least show stable performance.

##### Confidence

I investigate the relation between the reported confidence for an answer
and its correctness, to check if it is possible to inform humans in the
loop about results they should double check and which results they can
trust. Figure \@ref(fig:confidence-match-plot-mistral-binary) shows the
distribution of reported confidence score for the binary classification
with target type **Aktiva** for all tables types grouped by their
correctness for Mistral-8B-Instruct-2410. The \acr{LLM} just returns one
prediction and its confidence[^05_results-16]. The abscissa shows
$confidence = exp(logprob)$, if the answer is *yes* and
$confidence = 1-exp(logprob)$ if the answer is *no*.
:::

[^05_results-16]: The model could be forced to return multiple answers,
    but it was not. The confidence score is given as log probability.
    The exponential function was applied to show the results on the more
    common scale of 0 to 1.

```{r confidence-match-plot-mistral-binary-data-prep, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag}
target_type <- "Aktiva"

df_filtered <- df_binary %>% filter(
  classification_type == target_type, n_examples<=3
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(f1_score))

df_temp <- df_filtered[1,"predictions"][[1]][[1]] %>% as_tibble()

df_flipped_score <- df_temp %>% 
  mutate(
    confidence_score = if_else(predicted_type == "no", 1-confidence_score, confidence_score),
    is_aktiva = str_detect(type, target_type)
  )

model_name_best_f1_aktiva <- df_filtered[1, "model"]
method__best_f1_aktiva <- df_filtered[1, "method"]
```

One can see that the predictions are very accurate making just
`r sum(df_temp$match==FALSE)` mistakes for `r length(df_temp$match)`
predictions. The reported confidence for answer *yes* is showing a wide
spread from around 0.25 to 1.0. This is true for the answer *no* as
well. Most wrong decisions are made for responses that have a reported
confidence in the range from 0.25 to 0.75. But there are more correct
answers in this range as well. It never misclassifies **GuV** or
**Passiva**[^05_results-17] as **Aktiva**. But it with shows some not
recalled **Aktiva** tables and is predicting some of the pages of
majority class, with not further described content and structure, as
**Aktiva**.

[^05_results-17]: There was a single prediction where \acr{LLM} predicts
    **Aktiva** with high confidence, when the truth is **Passiva**
    instead. Because Qwen was showing the same wrong prediction for one
    **Passiva** table, I double checked the ground truth. I found, that
    the page shows **Aktiva** and **Passiva** simultaneously and was not
    correct codified. This was not the only time, where a mistake in the
    gold truth was found, by examining potential \acr{LLM} mistakes.

  )

model_name_best_f1_aktiva <- df_filtered[1, "model"]
method__best_f1_aktiva <- df_filtered[1, "method"]
```

This is different for models of most other model families. Figure
\@ref(fig:confidence-match-plot-qwen-binary) shows, that
`r model_name_best_f1_aktiva` returns always high confidence scores,
even when it is wrong. The model shows perfect recall but its precision
is worse than the precision of the Mistral model.

Figure \@ref(fig:micro-pr-curve-llm-binary-1) shows the
precision-recall-curve for the best performing model twice for each
target type. On the left plots the line color represents the threshold
score one could use to decide when to accept a response as it is. On the
right plots the line color is showing the F1 score that results with a
chosen threshold.

The \acr{AUC} value is lowest for **Aktiva**. Here the F1 score is
highest for a threshold value of 0.73. This prevents to classify the
pages of type *other* to get classified as **Aktiva**. If it is required
to have a very high recall value a threshold of 0.44 should be chosen.

The precision-recall-curve for **Passiva** is very similar but there is
a step close to the recall value of 1.0. This has the effect that for a
a guaranteed high recall a very low precision (0.24) and F1 (0.38) has
to be accepted[^05_results-18].

[^05_results-18]: Thus, a human has in average to check four pages and
    select the correct **Passiva** page among them.

The shape of the precision-recall-curve for **GuV** almost perfectly
reaches the top right corner. The highest F1 score is found with a
threshold value of .56. With a threshold value of 0.5 a very high recall
is guaranteed and the F1 score is just a little lower.

Figure \@ref(fig:table-identification-llm-confidence) summarizes the
relation between reported confidence and correctness of the
classification for all target types and compares it among the best
performing model-strategy combinations for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410
and Qwen3-8B. One can see, that the reported confidence for correct and
incorrect classifications are separable in most cases for Mistral-8B.
This separation is worse for Qwen3-8B and worst for target type
**Passiva**.

Figure \@ref(fig:table-identification-llm-confidence-lm) shows, that for
Ministral-8B values with a confidence of 0.7 and more, a human don't has
to double check the classification for target type **GuV**. This
interval is smallest for **Passiva** where only confidences above 0.9
can be fully trusted. These empirical intervals might shrink, once more
data is evaluated. If one is less strict and accepts misclassifiaction
rates of 1 % the found interval for **Passiva** starts at 0.8 and is
probably less depended on the sample evaluated. The percentage of
predictions that can be trusted without risk is greater than 93 % even
for target type **Passiva**.

For Qwen3-8B we find almost no range without any wrong classifications.
For **GuV** this range includes 35 % of all predictions. The ranges that
allow for 1 % of wrong classifications cover 57 % of all predictions at
least.

Discussion:

-   Could be more efficient to predict "is any of interest" and then
    which type, because dataset is highly imbalanced.

-   Why takes n_rag_examples so much longer?

-   **Aktiva** and **Passiva** sometimes on the same page and more
    similar than **GuV**?

-   Recall = 1 for human in the loop (looking at selection of pages that
    could be target and none else, if the number of wrong pages are few
    =\> what says F1 with recall 1?)

-   Confidence range to error rate

#### Multi-class classification

Table \@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-page-identification-multi) shows that
Llama-4-Scout solves the \acr{mcc} task almost perfect for all classes.
Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411 performs second best. In contrast to the
binary classification task no order is visible, what class was easiest
to predict. Googles gemma models perform much better in the \acr{mcc}
task with F1 scores of 0.89 instead of 0.58 for the binary
classification task.

Table
\@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-page-identification-multi-small-models)
shows that the smaller models do perform good, too. Ministral-8B
performs good but is around tenfold faster than Mistral-Large and
Llama-4 Scout. For the larger models the *n_rag_examples* strategy is
performing best. For the smaller models the *top_n_rag_examples*
strategy is performing good as well and is faster because of shorter
contexts.

```

Figure
\@ref(fig:performance-over-runtime-multi-classification-mistral-vs-llama-scout)
shows, the micro averaged F1 score for the three minority classes over
the normalized runtime for two models. It shows the results for the
different prompting strategies (*method_families*) with differently
colored shapes.

The shape is giving information, if the examples provided to the
\acr{LLM}, are exclusively selected from other companies than the target
table comes from, or if they can also be selected from documents of the
same company. This is only relevant for strategies that get the examples
picked by the documents vector embedding distances (*top_n_rag_examples*
and *n_rag_examples*). The \acr{LLM} performs better, if examples from
documents of the same company can be used.

The number inside of the shapes is referring to the *n_examples*
function parameter. Most models got benchmarked with an *n_examples*
value of up to three. The actual number of examples provided to the
models is depending on the method family / example selection strategy
and can be looked up in Table
\@ref(tab:comparing-actual-number-of-in-context-examples).

*n_rag_examples* better for Llama 4 Scout than *n_random_examples* ; For
Ministral it is depending on the *out_of_company* setting

On can see, that Ministral‚Äì8B 2410 reaches a good performance already
with few examples, but only if *out_of_company* is false. It performs
moderate with the *law-context* strategy and *zero_shot*, too. Adding
more examples does not improve the performance. Best with
*top_n_rag_examples*

##### Confidence

Figure \@ref(fig:confidence-match-plot-llama-multi) shows the reported
confidence scores for the predictions for the best performing
model-strategy combination, Llama 4 Scout with *3_rag_examples*. It is
confident for most correct predictions and only misclassifies some of
the pages with unknown characteristics. The target types are all
recognized correct. All confidences are greater than 0.5. Probably
because there is no case where the confidences for all possible classes
is below 0.5 and there always is a most probable class. It would have
been interesting to use the classification framework of \acr{vllm} to
get predictions for all competing classes. But this requires special
trained models with pooling capability[^05_results-19].
:::

[^05_results-19]: It might be possible to request the n most probable
    answers to get confidence scores for all different predictions. But
    this was not investigated.

Figure \@ref(fig:confidence-match-plot-mistral-multi) shows the reported
confidence scores for the predictions for the best performing
model-strategy combination among the small models limited to
*n_examples* with n smaller five[^05_results-20],
Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 with *3_rag_examples*. One can see there are
some wrong classifications for the minority classes as well. Especially,
the **Passiva** target type is often classified as *other*. This is
problematic for a smooth workflow (see discussion chapter?)

[^05_results-20]: The best performance results with
    *top_11_rag_examples* but the plot was less interesting and its F1

Figure \@ref(fig:micro-pr-curve-llm-multi-ministral) shows the
precision-recall-curve for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 with
*3_rag_examples* twice for each target type. On the left plots the line
color represents the threshold score one could use to decide when to
accept a response as it is. On the right plots the line color is showing
the F1 score that results with a chosen threshold.

The \acr{AUC} is highest for **GuV** again. But for the multi-class
classification **Passiva** shows the lowest \acr{AUC}, not **Aktiva** as
it was in the binary classification task. The precision-recall-curve for
**Aktiva** and \*\*Passiva\*+ show a "step" in the area of high recall.
This has a strong effect on the threshold one should choose, if one
wants to guarantee a high recall. The corresponding precision values of
0.2 and 0.13 mean that a human has to check five to eight pages in
average to get a correct classified page of type **Aktiva** and
**Passiva**.

The corresponding plot for the best performing model,
Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, can be found in Figure
\@ref(fig:micro-pr-curve-llm-multi-llama-scout). Here the
precision-recall-curve for **Passiva** and **GuV** is almost perfect.
Just the single prediction for **Aktiva** wit a lower confidence shows
an influence on the precision-recall-curve.

Figure \@ref(fig:table-identification-llm-confidence-multi) summarizes
the relation between reported confidence and correctness of the
classification for all target types and compares it among the best
performing model-strategy combinations for
Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410 and Qwen3-8B.
It seems, as the reported confidence for correct and incorrect
classifications are separable in most cases for Mistral-8B. For Llama 4
Scout this seems not true for the target type **GuV**. For Qwen3-8B
there is almost no separation at all.

Figure \@ref(fig:table-identification-llm-confidence-lm-multi) shows,
that there is almost no area, where the empirical rate of wrong
classifications is zero[^05_results-21]. Only for Ministral-8B we find
intervals, where a human don't has to double check the classification
for target types **Aktiva** and **GuV**. These intervals include 90 % of
all predictions. If error rates of 1 % are accepted almost all
predictions by Llama Scout 4 and about 96 % of the predictions by
Ministral-8B are included in the corresponding intervals. For Qwen3-8B
we find no interval without an error rate below 1 %.

[^05_results-21]: The size of intervals has been narrowed down to 0.1 %
    and still there was no range without wrong classification for Llama
    4 Scout.

### Term frequency based classifier {#tf-classifier}

The fourth approach uses term frequencies for a key word list and the
number of floats to rank pages. The approach is inspired by
\acr{TF-IDF} - a technique commonly used for information retrieval. It
is similar to the baseline approach, because it uses a key word list and
regular expressions to count terms and floats. But it is more flexible
because the works in the key word list are not mandatory. This makes the
approach robust against issues in the text extracts for single key
words.

The key word list is generated removing the stop words from the law
about **Aktiva**, **Passiva** and **GuV**. The key words from the
\acr{regex} approach are added, e.g. *GuV* and *Gewinn- und
Verlustrechnung*. Since real life representations of those target types
never contain all entries, it is not possible to include most of those
words in a strict \acr{regex} search as presented in the first approach.

This approach sums the counts of each word from the key word list per
page in a first variable. In a second variable it counts the number of
floats on each page. These two variables are then divided by the number
of words found on the page. These densities are used to rank all pages
from a single document. This is done with a unique key word list for
each target type.

A random forest is trained to determine which density should be weighted
to what amount. Because of the imbalanced data set undersampling is used
when the training data set is created[^05_results-22]. A single random
forest is trained because the density of floats and specific words is
assumed to be similar. The actual type of the page is not taken into
account. The model just knows if the page is a page of any target type,
based on the term and float density. This trippels the data points of
the target class.

[^05_results-22]: The random forest build with undersampling performs
    much better as a classifier, that is trained using n oversamples
    train dataset.

This single random forest performs much better than random forests that
are trained using the dataset for each target type separatly. The
performance is tested on all data points not included in the
undersampled train dataset. Thus the test dataset is again highly
imbalanced.

The random forest performs a binary classification task. But instead of
the actual classifications, the predicted scores are used to rank the
pages. Instead of precision or recall the metric used for the evaluation
is top k recall. It is of interest which value of k is required to get a
recall of 100 %.

Figure \@ref(fig:forest-map-tf-2-predictors) shows how the test data
points are distributed in the two dimensional value map for the random
forest with two predictors. The target pages have a *float_frequncy*
between 0.2 and 0.5 and pages with a *term_frequency* value over 0.07
get classified as target. One target page shows a lower *term_frequency*
and thus does not get ranked correct. (recall, precision?)

A second random forest is trained supplementing the two predictors *term
density* and *float density* with two additional predictors: *date
count* and *integer count*. Figure
\@ref(fig:top-n-recall-term-frequency) shows the top n recall for both
random forests. On the left side the top n recall on the imbalanced test
dataset is shown. On the right side the performance on the train
dataset.

Both random forests perform similar on the train dataset. The random
forest with four predictors reaches perfect recall faster for **Aktiva**
on the test dataset. Thus, with $n = 5$ 100 % recall is reached for the
random forest with four predictors. With the random forest with two
predictors it needs $n = 7$.

Figure \@ref(fig:shap-tf-4-predictors) shows that the two additional
predictors *date_count* and *integer_count* have little importance. But
since it is computationally cheap to determine their value and the
effiency of a random forest classifier, there is little reason not to
use them.

all types for threshold values up to at least 0.72.

        ))
```

In this subsection we summarize the performnce and efficiency for all
four presented approaches and compare it with the the results a human
may achieve with manual labour.

::: paragraph-start
##### Prediction performance

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-performance-overview-all) shows the
best performance of achieved by the four presented approaches. The best
F1 score is reached by Llama 4 Scout for the target types **Akiva** and
**Passiva** in the multi-class classification approach. For **GuV** the
best F1 score (0.985) is found with Ministral-8B-Instruct in the binary
classification approach. Llama 4 Scout reaches a F1 score of 0.971 for
target type **GuV** and multi-class classification.
:::

In the dataset preparation for the table extraction task (see section
\@ref(table-extraction-introduction) 107 **Aktiva** pages have been
selected. In this manual process we made two mistakes, accidently
selecting one **Passiva** and one **GuV** page. Thus the human baseline
to compete with is 0.981. Thus, Llama 4 Scout is more precise than us.

Furthermore, Llama 4 Scout reached a recall of 1.0 for all target types.
This means, the results can be used downstream, even though the
precision is not always perfect. The pages classified as target can be
double checked by a human, without missing any page.

The other approaches' performance is way worse. Only the term-frequency
approach's results could be used downstream, because we find a recall of
1.0. Table
\@ref(tab:page-identification-performance-overview-top-k-recall) shows
the results of the top k recall for the term-frequency and \acr{LLM}
approaches. The \acr{LLM}s always rate the correct **GuV** page highest.
With Llama Scout 4 we find all target pages within the first two ranked
pages. For the term-frequency approach a human sometimes has to check up
to five pages.

```{r page-identification-performance-overview-all, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
 df_df_page_identification_comparing_performance_formatted %>% 
   select(-c(`top 1 recall`, `k for full recall`)) %>% 
  render_table(
    alignment = "lllrrr",
    caption = "Comparing page identification perfromance among all four approaches.",
    ref = opts_current$get("label"))
```

```{r page-identification-performance-overview-top-k-recall, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results='asis'}
 df_df_page_identification_comparing_performance_formatted %>% 
   select(-c(precision, recall, F1)) %>% 
   filter(!is.na(`top 1 recall`)) %>% 
  render_table(
    alignment = "lllrr",
    caption = "Comparing the top k recall for the term-frequency and LLM approaches.",
    ref = opts_current$get("label"))
```

::: paragraph-start
##### Energy usage and runtime

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-efficiency-overview-all) shows the
runtime in seconds per document, estimated energy consumption in Joule
per document and costs in CENTS **per 1000 documents**. The runtime for
the \acr{LLM}s was normalized to seconds on a nvidia B200 and thus the
TDP of 700 W is used to calculate the energy consumption. For the other
approaches, running on my laptop (see section \@ref(local-machine)) a
TDP of 28 Watts is used. For manual work by a human additional 60 W are
added for the screen used. It is assumed that the \acr{LLM} is hosted
locally.
:::

Table \@ref(tab:page-identification-efficiency-overview-all) shows, that
the regular expression approach is fastest and consumes least energy.
Nevertheless, since the results are not sufficient another approach has
to be chosen if the amount of manual labor should be reduced for the
human inn the loop.

Second place regarding all these criteria is the term-frequency
approach, which guarantees a perfect recall, while reducing the number
of pages to investigate to five per target type. This is similar to the
number of pages a human has to investigate to find the \acr{TOC} of the
document. And it is a reduction to 7.4 % of the average 67 pages the
documents in this dataset have. The costs are still negligible.

The \acr{LLM} approaches have the highest runtime and energy
consumption. This is the case, because they process every page with very
computational demanding algorithms. The fastest and least energy
consuming strategy is to use a small model as Ministral-8B-Instruct for
the multi-class approach. This is more effective than running three
binary classifications. An alternative approach could be to binary
predict if the page is of any target type and then perform a
classification, which type exactly the page is of. But the results of
the multi-class strategy are good enough as well. In both strategies the
k required for perfect recall is three, using the Ministral-8B-Instruct
model[^05_results-23].

[^05_results-23]: Potentially smaller fine tuned models can solve the
    task even more efficient.

For the \acr{TOC} approach \acr{LLM}s are used as well, but they process
far less of the documents pages. This can be achieved for the good
performing classification strategies by combining the term-frequency
approach with the \acr{LLM} approach.

The manual approach is the slowest. For the benchmark ten random
documents were processed by us. We used the \acr{TOC} and the search
function to find key words like **Aktiva** or **Bilanz**. Anyhow, its
almost as fast as the multi-classification using Llama 4 Scout. But it
requires eight times less energy. Comparing it to Ministral-8B-Instruct
it take three times longer but consumes less then half of the energy.

Not taken into account fo this comparison are factors like

-   costs to buy and maintain hardware (i.e. a GPU cluster).

-   higher costs per runtime if the \acr{LLM} compute is purchased from
    cloud providers. CLOUD: price if LLM is in the cloud \<-- print
    tokens used

    -   four classes (3 random examples): 11 k tokens

    -   binary (3 random examples): 6.5 k tokens

-   payment and insurance to pay for a human (e.g . student coworker).

-   the training time and energy consumption for training either

    -   a \acr{LLM} (probably done by the \acr{LLM} provider).

    -   a human (growing up, getting educated).

-   the energy consumed with the food humans eat.

Since all approaches but the manual identification need the text
extract, this runtime and energy consumption are also not listed (but
low).

```

###  {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The second research question asks, how \acr{LLM}s can be used, to
effectively extract specific information from a financial report. The
task for this thesis is to extract the numeric values for the assets
(*Aktiva*) table, which is part of the balance sheet (*Bilanz*).
Hereafter, the German term **Aktiva** will be used. We are limiting the
scope even further than in subsection
\@ref(page-identification-introduction), because it takes more time to
manually create the first reference dataset.

::: paragraph-start
##### Structured output

We are using a strict schema for the extraction process that is derived
from the legal text [@hgb_handelsgesetzbuch_2025, ¬ß266]. Actually, there
are three types of verbosity, that are defined in the law. Smaller
companies are permitted to create less detailed balance sheets. Our
schema is created based on the most detailed level. This is the form
most often found in the document base[^05_results-24].
:::

[^05_results-24]: Unfortunately, well known companies as BVG and BSR
    publish a less detailed form. Thus, their documents are not included
    in the document base for this task.

Using a strict schema has advantages has advantages for processing the
results in downstream tasks - i.e. for adding the results to a
relational database. It is also easier to compare the results with a
ground truth if the names of all rows and their order is fixed. The
schema is defined as \acr{ebnf}-grammar and passed as an argument to
\acr{vllm}.

::: paragraph-start
##### Gound truth dataset

For the manual information extraction we need up to 12 minutes per
table. The maximum amount of values to copy and format (or type
manually) among the tables used is 40. In addition to this manual
process conceptional process can be necessary, because the values have
to matched to the strict grammar. Sometimes we have to decide that there
is no row a value fits in or there are multiple values that have to get
summed up in order to calculate the value that fits in the predefined
schema.
:::

This manual work was done for `r old_doc_base %>% nrow()` documents. For
every company that published the detailed form of balance sheets a
single document was included. Additionally documents were included for
*Amt f√ºr Statistik und Brandenburg* to check, if a context learning
approach is benefiting from documents from the same company. Later, the
predictions of the \acr{LLM}s were used, to create additional
`r new_doc_base %>% nrow()` ground truth tables. The old ground truth
tables were checked in this this iteration and an error rate of 2.4 %
was detected. Thus, the human reference score for percentage of correct
predictions is 0.976. Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-doc-base) shows
how many **Aktiva** tables are used for all tasks in this subsection,
that use real data instead of synthetic data.

To overcome the limited amount of real data and to allow the systematic
investigation of potential predictors for the extraction performance,
even if their occurrence is very unbalanced within the real data,
synthetic **Aktiva** tables were created (see subsection
\@ref(synthetic-table-extraction)).

```{r table-extraction-doc-base, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, out.width="100%", dev=std_dev, fig.cap="Showing the number of documents used for the table extraction task. The number of Aktiva tables is equal to the number documents."}
new_doc_base %>% rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    .before = 1, 
    company = str_match(filepath, "/pvc/benchmark_truth/real_tables_extended/(.*)__")[2],
    initial_doc_base = str_remove(filepath, "_extended") %in% old_doc_base$filepath
    ) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = company, fill = initial_doc_base)) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +

    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "top"
  )
```

synth_table_extraction_regex_NA_F1_mean <- df_table_extraction_regex %>% filter(table_type == "synth_tables", extraction_backend == "pymupdf") %>% pull(NA_F1) %>% mean(na.rm = TRUE)

table_extraction_regex_baseline_medians <- tribble(
  ~measure, ~real_mean, ~real_median, ~synthetic_mean, ~synthetic_median,
  "percentage of correct predictions total", real_table_extraction_regex_total_performance_mean, real_table_extraction_regex_total_performance_median, synth_table_extraction_regex_total_performance_mean, synth_table_extraction_regex_total_performance_median,

)
```

The baseline for the table extraction task is set by an approach using
regular expressions on the text extract. Figure
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-regex-performance) shows the performance of
this approach. In the first row (A) the percentage of correct predicted
numeric values and the percentage of total correct responses is shown.
The second row (B) shows the precision, recall and F1 score for
identifying a value as missing and thus predicting *null*. The
percentage of total correct responses is calculated as

$$
percentage\_correct\_total = \frac{n_{correct\_numeric} + n_{missing\_true\_positive}}{n_{total\_entries}}
$$

with $n_{total\_entries} = 58$ . This implies that the correct
prediction of missing values has more influence for tables, that have
only a few numeric values in the ground truth. The minimal number of
numeric values in a tables is ten. Figure
\@ref(fig:display-extraction-metrics-full-NA) shows, that the percentage
of total correct responses is not a sufficient metric, because responses
that only predicted *null* can have a high score if there are only a few
numeric values in the ground truth table.

##### Performance

In each frame there are two groups of two box-plots. The left group is
showing the performance on real **Aktiva** tables. The right group shows
the performance on synthetic **Aktiva** tables. Within the group the
green (left) box shows the performance on text extracted with the
*pdfium* library. The peach colored (right) box shows the performance on
text extracted with the *pymupdf* library.
:::

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-regex-performance) shows,
that the \acr{regex} approach performs better[^05_results-25] on the
synthetic tables compared to the real tables. Even though, the
performance is not perfect and more consistent on the text extracted
with *pymupdf* compared to *pdfium*. In contrast, the used text
extraction library has no noticeable influence on the real **Aktiva**
tables.

[^05_results-25]: A comparison of the numeric values over all methods
    can be found in section \@ref(comparing-table-extraction-methods).

The performance for the \acr{regex} based table extraction is much
better than the \acr{regex} based page identification performance. The
median performance scores of the \acr{regex} approaches will be
reflected by a dashed line in the box-plots in subsequent sections. The
scores for the real **Aktiva** table extraction are:

###### Real dataset

The formulated hypotheses have been evaluated visually using the
dependence and beeswarm plots from the shapviz library based on the
\acr{SHAP} values calculated with a random forest.
:::

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-real-table-extraction-regex-table) shows in the first column the predictors included in the random forests. Subsequent groups of two columns show the hypotheses and the found effects of those predictors for  two aggregated measures (F1 score and percentage of correct numeric predictions) and one value based measure (binomial correctness rating).

Predictors that are marked with an asterisk only have five or less representatives. Thus, those results are not reliable. Bold set hypotheses show the predictors, that showed the highest mean \acr{SHAP} values. For all measures but the binomial this means the effect is at least 0.025. For the binomial measure the effect of a predictor with bold hypothesis is at least 0.05. Results with red text highlight hypotheses that are not supported by the visual evaluation.

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-real-table-extraction-regex-table) shows many red results, meaning the corresponding hypothesis is getting no support. Since most of these findings show only minor effect strength we don't interpret them as strongly challenging those hypotheses. Only three findings regarding the F1 score show a strong effect and findings that do not align with our hypotheses. 
First, it seems, that finding a sum in the same row, has a negative effect of finding any valid number there. Second, it has negative effect, if the previous year column is given as *T‚Ç¨*. Third, it has negative effect, if the columns are visually separated.

see Figure \@ref(fig:real-table-extraction-regex-shap-plot)

```

::: paragraph-start
###### Synthetic dataset

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-synth-table-extraction-regex-table) shows, many red results as well, meaning the corresponding hypothesis is getting no support. We find more predictors with a strong effect compared to the real **Aktiva** table extraction task. The results are based on 24_576 extracted tables and the \acr{SHAP} values have been calculated on 2_000
examples each.
:::

Contrary to our assumption, does the *extraction_backend* have a strong effect on all measures. We find, that *pdfium* is struggling with some of the table
characteristics while *pymupdf* is not influenced by them. Figure
\@ref(fig:synth-table-extraction-regex-shap-num-details-plot) A shows
this exemplary for the characteristic *header_span*. An example for a erroneous text extraction with *pdfium* can be found in section \@ref(#regex-extraction-mistakes). Actually, all results that are marked with an asterisk are showing this effect if *pdfium* is used as extraction backend. This can be inspected in Figure \@ref(fig:synth-table-extraction-regex-dependence-plot-backend).

Furthermore, does the number of columns is have a positive effect overall. Figure
\@ref(fig:synth-table-extraction-regex-shap-num-details-plot) B shows, that this effect has inverse direction for the two libraries.

It might be worth noting, that the row for *Anteile an verbundenen
Unternehmen* was rated to have a clear negative effect on the chance to
extract the correct value.

The question, if visual separation of columns is having an effect, as
found for the real data, is not studied here, because in the synthetic
tables all columns are visually separated. But this could be
investigated in future work. It is possible, that the visual separation
is causing the faulty text extractions of *pdfium*.

This section presents the results for the table extraction task
performed with \acr{LLM}s on **Aktiva** tables. Subsection
\@ref(real-table-extraction-results) compraes the performance of open
source models on real tables. It also compares those results with the
table extraction performance achieved with models by OpenAI.

Subsection \@ref(synthetic-table-extraction) presents the results on
synthetic **Aktiva** tables. Subsection
\@ref(real-table-extraction-synth-context) shows a hybrid approach,
where synthetic tables are used for the in-context learning, to extract
real **Aktiva** tables. Finally, we summarize the results for all
approaches in subsection \@ref(comparing-table-extraction-methods).

##### Performance

For the table extraction task
`r length(unique(df_real_table_extraction$model))+2` open source models
from `r length(unique(df_real_table_extraction$model_family))` model
families have been benchmarked[^05_results-26]. Table
\@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction) shows the best
performing combination of \acr{LLM} and prompting strategy for each
model family. The results are sorted by their mean percentage of total
correct predictions. It also shows the normalized runtime in seconds and
the parameter number of the model.
:::

[^05_results-26]: The models *deepseek-ai_DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B*
    and *google_gemma-3n-E4B-it* have been tested as well but don't get
    presented as they never performed anywhere beyond random guessing.

Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct performed best with a mean score of
`r top_scoring_model_big_mean`. This is equal with the performance that
we achieved building the ground truth dataset. There are other models
that perform almost as good with a score of 0.96 and more, but that
don't match the human performance. These models show a median score of
1.0. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct is the second fastest of those well
performing models and needs less than six minutes. Only Llama 4 Maverick
is faster. It needs half the time to extract the information.

```{r table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results="asis"}
df_top_scoring_models_big %>% 
  mutate(
    median_total = round(median_total, 3),
    mean_total = round(mean_total, 3)
    ) %>% 
  render_table(caption = "Comparing best table extraction performance with real 'Aktiva' dataset for each model family", ref = opts_current$get("label"), alignment = "lllrrrrr", dom="t")
```

Table \@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction-small) shows the
performance of models with less than 17B parameters, that have not been
listed above. Qwen3-14B performs best among the smaller models achieving
a mean of `r top_scoring_model_small_mean` and median of 1.0. It takes
1:49 minutes to extract the information from all **Aktiva** tables.
Ministral-8B-Instruct does not perform as good as in the page
identification task.

```{r table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction-small, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag, results="asis"}
df_top_scoring_models_small %>% 
  filter(!model %in% df_top_scoring_models_big$model) %>% 
  mutate(
    median_total = round(median_total, 3),
    mean_total = round(mean_total, 3)
    ) %>% 
  render_table(caption = "Comparing best table extraction performance with real 'Aktiva' dataset for each model family for models with less than 17B parameters. Models that have been listes in the previous table are not listed again.", ref = opts_current$get("label"), alignment = "lllrrrrr", dom="t")
```

Most models need a context learning approach to beat the performance of
the regular expression approach at total and numeric correctness rate
and F1 score. Table \@ref(tab:zero-and-synth-performing-models-tab)
shows, that `r nrow(zero_shot_stars)` models perform better without any
guidance[^05_results-27]. `r nrow(static_example_stars)` models achieved
an performance better than the \acr{regex} baseline using the approach
to learn with a fixed example from the synthetic dataset.

[^05_results-27]: There is an external guidance through the provided
    xgrammar template but it is not communicated to the model in form of
    a promt.

In contrast: most of the models achieved a better performance than the
regex baseline when they were provided with one or more examples from
real **Aktiva** tables. Table
\@ref(tab:super-underperforming-models-tab) shows, that
`r nrow(super_underperformer)` don't consitently achieve a better score,
when provided with three or five real **Aktiva** table examples. Here we
find the smallest models with less than 2B parameters which don't
achieve a consistence performance no matter how many examples they get.
But we also find models that start to perform bad if they get a too long
context with too many examples like the very recent and large model
Llama 4 Maverick.

The results for all models are presented in Figure
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-performance-total-overview),
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-performance-numeric-overview) and
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-f1-overview). In general the performance
within a model family is positive correlated with the models number of
parameters, if we provide real **Aktiva** examples. Once the 4B
parameters are passed, the improvements get less and less, approaching
the perfect performance. But no model achieves sperfect result on all
documents. The *zero_shot* and *static_example* approach show some

##### OpenAI models

Even though a lot of documents to process at \acr{RHvB} will not be
public and thus must not be processed on public cloud infrastructure,
the performance of models like OpenAI's GPT are interesting benchmark
references within this thesis and for comparing these findings with
other papers results. Therefore for this thesis the public available
versions of annual reports have been used instead of the ones used
internally or for public administration purposes. Those public available
reports often are visually more appealing and more heterogeneous in
their structure.
:::

Table \@ref(tab.table-extraction-llm-performance-total-gpt-ranking)
shows the ranking for the best model-method combinations Qwen3 235B is
performing best. gpt-4.1 and gpt-5-mini perform equally well and are
almost as good as Qwen3 235B. All models but gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-5-nano
and Qwen3-0.6B manage to beat the \acr{regex} threshold. Qwen3-0.6B
performs better than the nano models once it gets provided with an
example.

Table \@ref(tab:costs-azure) shows the accumulated costs for the table
extraction task for the models provided by Azure. Using gpt-4.1 is most
expensive, followed by gpt-5-mini. Next is gpt-5-nano. This is caused by
an unexpected high cost for output tokens. In general we find, that the
ratio of output costs to input costs is much higher for gpt-5 models.
Since gpt-5-mini gives consistently good results already with one
provided example, this could be the most cost efficient strategy. But it
takes gpt-5-mini more than three times longer to respond than gpt-4.1.

Discussion?:

Since the output token costs are not that different (2 \$ for 1M output
tokens with gpt-5-mini vs 1.6 \$ with gpt-4.1-mini), the generated
output token number has to be much higher for the gpt-5-mini models. But
since the responses are based on the same schema and required the same
numeric values there shouldn't be a big difference[^05_results-28].

[^05_results-28]: With the gpt-oss models we found the new Harmony
    response format to produce a lot of tokens in the chain of thought
    stream, we discarded, because we only need the \acr{json} in the
    final stream Maybe this is similar for gpt-5 models as well but the
    chain of thought stream is kept on Azures side?

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-f1-gpt-slice) shows the
distribution of F1 score for up to three examples. It shows green
crosses at the bottom of the abscissa that indicate prediction, where no
*null* value is reported. This means, the model hallucinates many
numeric values. This is only the case for OpenAI's models but not for
Qwen3 models. This behaviour persists up to five examples for the nano
as well the gpt-oss 20b model. For gpt-4.1 and gpt-4.1-mini these cases
vanish when we provide three or more examples and never appeared for
gpt-5-mini.

One can find the full plots in Figures
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-performance-total-gpt),
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-performance-numeric-gpt) and
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-f1-gpt)).

We were not able to get OpenAI's models to stick to the provided
\acr{json} schema strictly. Passing the \acr{ebnf} grammar did not work
at all. This means that with gpt-4.1-nano there have been
`r df_overview_gpt %>% filter(n_predicted_values == 0, model == "gpt-4.1-nano") %>% nrow()`
predictions that have been completely empty. For gpt-5-nano we find
`r df_overview_gpt %>% filter(n_predicted_values == 0, model == "gpt-5-nano") %>% nrow()`
such predictions. Figure
\@red(fig:table-extraction-llm-prediction-count-gpt) shows the
distribution of responses with a wrong number of predictions (including
*null* and numeric predictions). Overall there have been
`r perc_wrong_prediction_count` % of the responses of OpenAI's models
that were compatible with the schema but had a wrong number of rows
predicted. The maximum number of returned values (by gpt-5-nano) is 714.

Using gpt-5-chat for the table extraction task with structured output is
not working, returning an error informing that a *json_schema* can't be
used with this model. Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-errors-gpt)
shows, where other models produced an answer that could not be parsed as
valid \acr{json}.Most errors occured for gpt-oss-20B and the
*static_example* method. Over half of all tables could not be
transcripted in \acr{json} with in the 40_000 response token
limit[^05_results-29]. Only with gpt-5-mini we had no \acr{json} parsing
error.

[^05_results-29]: Without the Harmony format 4_000 are enough.

##### Out of company performance

Table \@ref(tab:table-extraction-same-company-improvement-table) shows
the improvement for the percentage of correct predictions total, when
**Aktiva** tables from the same company as the target tables company are
provided for the in-context learning. It shows that this improvement is
biggest for goolge and Qwen and smallest for Llama models.
:::

Figure
\@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-performance-total-overview-out-of-company)
shows, that using **Aktiva** in-company examples improves the
performance, mainly by reducing the number of bad predictions. The found
improvement is present for all models but Llama 4 Maverick. Here the
number of bad predictions gets larger if we provide three or more
examples. With five examples the performances totally collapses.

The perfromance improvement for GPT-4.1-mini and GTP-4.1 with only one
provided example seems to be big, because the box is getting much more
narrow. But the median shifts not more than for other models.

##### Confidence

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence) shows, that the
distrubution of the models reported confidence is heterogeneous. Again,
Qwen3-8B reports very high confidence values no matter if the results
are correct or not. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (and Qwen3-14B) report some
lower confidence scores for predictions, where they are wrong. The
Mistral model again reports a wider range of confidences and for wrong
results the reporetd confidence is lower. But no real separation can be
observed for any of the models.
:::

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence-lm) helps answering the
question, if the reported confidence score of the responses can be used,
to alert a human that certain predictions might be wrong. In contrast to
the page identification task, we find no confidence intervals where the
mistake rate is equal 0 or less than 1 %. The majority of the
predictions has a very high reported confidence. For the best performing
model Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct we find error rates of
`r conf_scores_top["FALSE"]` % for numeric predictions and
`r conf_scores_top["TRUE"]` % for predicting a missing value.

Thus, we can inform the human about the empirical found error rates but
do not flag some values to be realy trustworthy. In defense for the
model: with manual transcription the error rate is not lower. But we can
inform the human about values that have shown a higher rate of mistakes,
especially for the Ministral model.

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-real-table-extraction-llm-table) shows in the first column the predictors included in the random forests. Subsequent groups of two columns show the hypotheses and the found effects of those predictors for  two aggregated measures (F1 score and percentage of correct numeric predictions) and two value based measures (binomial correctness rating and reported confidence for the prediction).

Predictors that are marked with an asterix only have five or less representatives. Thus, those results are not reliable. Bold set hypotheses show the predictors, that showed the highest mean \acr{SHAP} values. For all measures but the binomial this means the effect is at least 0.025. For the binomial measure the effect of a predictor with bold hypothesis is at least 0.05. Results with red text highlight hypotheses that are not supported by the visual evaluation.

For most measures the model and method related predictors (*model_family*, *parameter_count*, *method_family* and *n_examples*) show the strongest effects. Worth mentioning is, that *method_family* and *n_examples* show no strong effect on the reported confidence score. From the table related characteristics most strong effects show the hypothesized direction. Not predicted was the negative effect of label length on the reported confidence score. The visual separation of columns and rows shows small effects. We find no support for a negative effect of the fact that the **Passiva** table is on the same page as the **Aktiva** table.

##### Ground truth dataset

For this task we created synthetic **Aktiva** tables that should allow
to investigate the influence certain characteristics of tables on the
extraction task. We systematically created **Aktiva** tables that vary
over the following characteristics:
:::

1.  n_columns: Number of columns the numeric values are distributed over
    ranging from 2 to 4.
2.  header_span: Span in the header rows.
3.  thin: Including just a subset of all possible entries for a
    **Aktiva** table.
4.  unit_in_first_cell: Is the currency unit (e.g. T‚Ç¨) given in the
    beginning of the table instead for each column.
5.  enumeration: Are the rows numerated following the schema in the
    legal text.
6.  many_line_breaks: Limiting the character length for the row
    descriptions to 50 to introduce line breaks.
7.  shuffle_rows: The order of the rows within lower hierarchies can
    vary.
8.  text_around: There is some random text before and after the table on
    the generated page.
9.  sum_same_line: Summed values are in the same line as single values
    if there are more than two columns.
10. unit: Eight different currency units from. E.g.: ‚Ç¨, TEUR, Mio. ‚Ç¨
11. input_format: Table is exported as PDF, HTML or Markdown document.

This results in `r n_synth_tables` tables. A sample of 10 % is used for
the extraction task. The *header_span* and *text_around* are only varied
for the PDF format.

##### Extraction task overview

For the table extraction task with synthetic **Aktiva** tables
`r length(unique(df_synth_table_extraction$model))` open source models
from `r length(unique(df_synth_table_extraction$model_family))` model
families have been benchmarked. There have been the same seven methods
tested with each \acr{LLM} as described in section
\@ref(extraction-with-llms-real-tables). Each method was used twice,
because in one trial the \acr{LLM} is prompted to respect the currency
units and in the other trail it is not.
:::

This results in `r n_synth_table_extraction` files, that hold the
results of 4_915 table extractions each. For the investigation of
potential predictors influences the random forest is generated with a
sample of 50_000 of these 68_810 results and finally, the \acr{SHAP}
values are calculated with 2_000 rows of data.

::: paragraph-start
##### Performance

Table \@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction-synth-context)
shows the best performing combination of \acr{LLM} and prompting
strategy for each model family. The results are sorted by their mean
percentage of total correct predictions. We only compare results for
table extractions that work with a PDF document based table here.
:::

For every model family there is at least one model-method combination
that performed better than the \acr{regex} baseline. For the synthetic
table extraction task the baseline is
`r round(synth_table_extraction_regex_total_performance_median, 3)`.
`r deframe(n_better_as_regex)['TRUE']` from `r sum(n_better_as_regex)`
model-method combinations perform better than this baseline. There has
been no model that performed better than this baseline with the
*zero_shot* or *static_example* method.

Table \@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction-synth-context)
shows, that Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct performs best. Llama 4 Scout also
performs very good but is three times faster. Table
\@ref(tab:table-metrics-llm-real-table-extraction-synth-context-small)
shows three small \acr{LLM}s that also beat the median threshold for the
synthetic table extraction task. But we would not prefer the Qwen3-8B
model over the Llama Scout model, because its speed advantage is to
small, compared to the performance decrease. But if there is limited
VRAM available the Qwen3 model is a good choice. It can run well with 40
GB VRAM. The Llama Scout needs 640 GB VRAM to run well[^05_results-30].

[^05_results-30]: When we say, it runs well, it gets rated as *okay* on
    the [LLM Inference: VRAM & Performance
    Calculator](https://apxml.com/tools/vram-calculator).

Detail:

Figure
\@ref(fig:synth-table-extraction-llm-performance-numeric-overview)
shows, that Llama 3.3 70B never manages to reduce the spread in the
numeric prediction performance.

##### Confidence

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence-lm-synth) shows, that we do not find a high confidence interval containing a majority of the predictions with 0 % error rate. But for Qwen3-235B we find, that the error rate is below 1 %, except for predicting numeric values, while ignoring their currency units.
:::

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence-lm-synth-grouped-by-input-format) groups the responses additonally by the *input_format* of the documents. It shows, that with HTML documents Qwen3-235B achieves 0 % error rate for the prediction of missing values and predicting numeric values, if currency units get respected.

##### Hypotheses

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-synth-table-extraction-llm-table) shows some unsupported hypotheses for predictors with strong effects. The observations suggest, that prompting the model to respect the currency units is decreasing its performance to predict the correct numeric values. This is understandable, if the task is reflected properly and we made a mistake there, when we formulated our hypothesis.
:::

If the model is not prompted to respect the currency units, it is presented with examples that just copy over the numeric values. And it gets evaluated if it copied the values correctly. If the model is prompted to respect the currency units, it is presented with examples, where the values not only get copied but also transformed. And they get evaluated if they do the transformation correct as well. Thus the task is harder, if numeric values should be respected and the effect is having a negative direction.

Figure \@ref(fig:better-performance-for-value-transformation-with-html-and-md) shows that the transformation task is handled best, if the examples are provided with the *top_n_rag* strategy. It does not work with the *zero_shot* strategy. It also shows, that the performance is lower with the PDF *input_format* and that the models have difficulties, if the *unit_multiplier* is one million. This also shows a strong effect and is strongest for the PDF *input_format*. This is a general effect. We see in \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence-lm-synth) that it can be different for single models like Qwen3-235B.

old:

HTML and Markdown better but expected interaction effects mostly not
found - except: - columns help pdf - thinning least bad for pdf - pdf
worst with numbers that have currency units (short numbers, maybe no
1000er delimiter) - enumeration positive for pdf (and interaction with
log10 mult)

line breaks are no problem

zero shot gets confused by text around

Markdown might be even better than HTML

respecting units was bad - except for: Top n rag finds examples with
same currency units (shorter numbers more important than currnency in
header?)

log10 multiplier has many interaction effects

LLama 4 Maverick again problem with five examples

Positive column count effect (different for real data)

In this section we present the results of using synthetic **Aktiva**
tables for the in-context learning to extract information from real
**Aktiva** tables. We show that even such a hybrid approach can be used,
to extend the extraction task by a unit conversation task.

::: paragraph-start
##### Performance

Table
\@ref(tab:comparing-extraction-performance-real-and-synth-context-learning)
compares the overall performance for the extraction task of the best
model-method combination in the hybrid approach per model with the
*zero_shot* and real example training performance. Using real examples
for in-context-learning for those model-method combinations is better
than using the generated synthetic data. Qwen3-8B and gemma3-12b can
improve the most using real examples instead of sythetic examples,
normalized on the possible improvement from the synthetic learning
results using this formula:
:::

$$
delta\_rate_{synth} = \frac{median \left( real \right)-median \left( synth \right)}{1-median \left( synth \right)}
$$

On the same time, gemma3-12b shows the lowest *delta_rate* with under 10 %, when the improvement of using synthetic examples is compared with the *zero_shot* method. For the other models this is more tan 48 % and highest for Llama Scout 4 with 87.5 % improving from 0.45 to 0.93. Qwen-235B score as high with both learning approaches, but scored best with just using a single synthetic example. Table \@ref(tab:comparing-extraction-performance-real-and-synth-context-learning-median) shows that these observations are valid for the improvement with in the models independent from the selected method. Figure \@ref(fig:compare-real-table-extraction-by-context-type) shows, that the improvement for using one or three synthetic examples is biggest for Qwen3-8B.

##### Learning to respect currency units

Table
\@ref(tab:comparing-extraction-performance-synth-context-learning-respecting-units-table)
shows, the difference in the percentage of correct predicted numeric values, if the \acr{LLM} is prompted to respect currency units and gets synthetic **Aktiva** tables that show how to cope with different currency units, separate for the number of columns with currency units. There are `r n_tables_n_cols %>% deframe() %>% .["1"]` tables that have *T‚Ç¨* in the previous year column and `r n_tables_n_cols %>% deframe() %>% .["2"]` tables that have all columns listed in *T‚Ç¨*.
:::

It shows, that Qwen3-235B, Llama 4 Scout, Mistral-Large and Ministral-8B all can apply the demonstrated numeric transformation for most of the values, if both columns have the *T‚Ç¨* unit. Qwen3-235B, Llama 4 Scout and Mistral-Large also can apply this, if only one columns has a unit corrency. This works best for Qwen3-235B. The target value to archive here is 0.5 instead of 1.0. This is worth to mentioning because there are no synthetic examples that haf different currency units for different columns. Ministral can not generalize this skill. It seems, that Qwen3 apllies numeric transformations regardles the fact, if there are currency units given for a column. Thus, it performs noticeably worse on the majority of all tables. Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-respecting-units-plot) shows, that the performance of Llama 3.1 8B and gemma3 27B on colums with currency units does not change. 

\@ref(fig:compare-effect-of-respecting-units-on-overall-performance),
\@ref(fig:compare-effect-of-respecting-units-on-numeric-performance) and
\@ref(fig:compare-effect-of-respecting-units-on-NA-F1)

Thus, synthetic data can be used to solve new tasks and substitute
missing data for rare classes.

```

::: paragraph-start
##### Confidence

Figure \@ref(fig:table-extraction-llm-confidence-lm-synth-context) shows the rate of wrong predictions for given confidence intervals. Again, the confidence for predicting a missing value is higher than for predicting a numeric value. One can't see much difference, but for the best performing model Qwen3-235B the error rate for numeric values is lower, when currency units are respected (20 % vs 26 %). But the error rate is still to high to mark any numeric value as trustful.

##### Hypotheses

Table \@ref(tab:hypotheses-and-results-real-table-extraction-llm-synth-context-table) shows only one unsupported hypothesis for a predictor with a strong effect: *method_family*. Figure \@ref(fig:static-example-best-dependence-plot) shows the dependence plot for the this predictor. The prompting strategy *static_example* shows the highest \acr{SHAP} values. This is surprising, because the the *static example* is equivalent to providing a single random example.

### Comparison {#comparing-table-extraction-methods}

This subsection compares the results for the table extraction tasks. It will discuss the findings about performance and runtime and compare it with the results a human may achieve wit manual labor.

::: paragraph-start
##### Performance

Table \@ref(tab:compare-extraction-performance) summarizes the mean percentage of correct predictions total for all approaches and both types of **Aktiva** tables. The highest baseline for the extraction tasks is set by our own manual performance. We achieve 97.6 % correct extracted values on the real **Aktiva** tables. The \acr{regex} performance on the synthetic **Aktiva** tables comes close but on real **Aktiva** tables it is far off.
:::

The mean performance of Qwen3-235B does not match our baseline on the real **Akiva** tables. But its median performance already is 100 %. The extraction performance may get higher, if the in-context learning examples show how to deal with columns that have a currency unit. But the strong performance observed right now is already based on implicit numeric transformations, since 19.2 % of all numeric values have *T‚Ç¨* as unit. Furthermore, both measures, percentage of correct numeric predictions (98.0 %) and F1 score (98.1 %) are not perfect yet and could be improved.

On synthetic tables its mean performance is almost perfect, if currency units get respected. The 0.1 % incorrect prediction from the PDF documents could be caused by faulty text extracts by *pdfium*. With HTML documents we find 100 % correct predictions.  With Markdown documents we find 99.9 % correct predictions as well. Figure \@ref(fig:comparing-table-extraction-performance-among-real-and-synth-aktiva-data) shows, that the better performance on the synthetic tables is found for almost all models.

Qwen3-8B performed best among the small models \acr{LLM}s but shows over 4 % more wrong predictions than Qwen3-235B. Using synthetic examples, results in worse performance. But it can be used to show how to handle currency units.

```{r compare-extraction-performance, echo=echo_flag, warning=warning_flag, message=message_flag}

  ~approach, ~strategy, ~table_type, ~percentage_correct_total,

) %>% kbl(caption = "Comparing the mean percentage of correct predictions total among all approaches and table types.")
```

::: paragraph-start
##### Runtime

Extracting the values from all 106 tables took Qwen3-235B around six minutes. Thus, excluding the setup time for the LLM, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct is
around 100 times faster than a human. Checking the extracted values takes up to three minutes. This totals in 300 minutes prediction checking. Thus, selecting a smaller model that is finishing after 2:30 minutes is not speeding up the process a lot. Once we get a sufficient good performance with the big models the prediction checking can be dropped. This would bring th real benefit.
:::

::: paragraph-start
##### Hypotheses

The predictor that showed a strong effect in all approaches is currency unit. Reflecting this in the table extraction is a key factor to optimize the performance. For the approaches that use \acr{LLM}s most of the model and method related variables showed a strong effect. Using a versatile model and providing good learning examples is mandatory.
:::

Especially for the approaches that use synthetic tables show that the input format could also have a meaningful effect. It seems important to prevent erroneous text extraction and converting the extracted text in HTML might be helpful to eliminate last unclarities. But the question, if a perfect text extract would be as good as HTML or Markdown, is not answered yet.
